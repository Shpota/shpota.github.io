My name is Sasha Shpota. I am a programmer. I write
mostly in Java, but also in Go, Kotlin, TypeScript/JavaScript,
and occasionally in Python. At the moment, I work as a full-stack 
developer. In my day to day work, I implement back end
functionality together with the front end, take care of their
quality and deliver the applications using Docker and
Kubernetes.

I am an active open-source contributor and have authored
several tools and applications, which you can find on
[my GitHub](https://github.com/Shpota). The most popular
is [Goxygen](https://github.com/Shpota/goxygen) - a tool
that generates full-stack web projects with Go on the
back end and Angular, React or Vue on the front end.

I believe that in the programming field it is important
to collaborate with the development community, help others,
and accept help yourself. That's why I contribute regularly 
to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2065796/sasha-shpota?tab=profile)
by answering programming questions as well as asking them.


I am a big fan of the DevOps culture and I think
that a modern developer must manage the full application
cycle from designing the application to delivering it to
end-users. I also think that automation is the best way
to make programmers’ lives easier.

In my spare time, I like reading books, going to the 
gym, traveling and enjoying free time with my family. 
Of course, I [code](https://github.com/Shpota) from
time to time. In the meantime I like exploring 
new cultures and new languages - I am learning
German at the moment, and I can't wait until I am
able to communicate freely with native speakers.

On this blog, I share my thoughts mostly about software
development and on everything that interests me.
